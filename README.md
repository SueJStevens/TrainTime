## Overview
This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data as well as Moment.js to manipulate and display the data. The website will provide up-to-date information about various made-up trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## Functionality
* Administrators can add/submit the following:    
  * Train Name    
  * Destination     
  * First Train Time -- in military time    
  * Frequency -- in minutes  
* The app will calculate when the next train will arrive relative to the current time.  
* Users from many different machines can view same train times.
